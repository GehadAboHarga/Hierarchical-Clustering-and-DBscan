# Hierarchical-Clustering-and-DBscan
In main scrpt, conduct hierarchical clustering and DBscan on the Iris dataset which contains 4 dimensions/attributes and 150 samples
In DB scan code, we will use DBSCAN to cluster a couple of datasests. We will examine how changing its parameters (epsilon and min_samples) changes the resulting cluster structure.


## Dependencies
- matplotlib
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn

## Usage
Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder and run the following commands

`python3 Hierarchical_Clustering.py`

or

`python3 DBSCAN.py`

(Optional) __If you plan to install TensorFlow with GPU support on your local machine__, follow [the guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) to install the necessary NVIDIA software on your system.  If you are using an EC2 GPU instance, you can skip this step.
